                <h2>Cafe Recommendations in East Bay</h2>
                <p>As a former teacher, I've spent countless hours after school in cafes, 
                    grading papers, reading books, and answering emails. Since then, I have 
                    come to appreciate cafes a lot and many have asked me for my
                    recommendation, so here they are! (They all have wifi, relatively good
                    coffee, outlets, and easy parking.)
                </p>

                <h1>Allegro</h1>
                <h3 class="location">Berkeley, CA</h3>
                <p>Located in a Whole Foods market, the cafe has a wide open space, 
                    free wifi, and plenty of outlets along the walls. My favorite 
                    part about this place is you can also grab food from the hot deli 
                    section in Whole Foods.</p>
    
                <p>The high tables are also great for using as standing desks.</p>

                <h1>Kaleidoscope</h1>
                <h3 class="location">Point Richmond, CA</h3>
                <p>This place feels like home. It's a small and quaint place located 
                    in Point Richmond. There are these larger tables that seat 4 people
                    that's nice for studying in a group. The baristas are really friendly. 
                    There is also a section of the cafe with couches and beanbags. Sometimes,
                    before setting down at the cafe, I will go take a walk at the local park.

                <h1>Inklings</h1>
                <h3 class="location">Pleasanton, CA</h3>
                <p>Inklings is an interesting cafe with two sections. One section, 
                    the front of the cafe has walls lined with books and gives off
                    the vibe of an antique store turned hip cafe. The back of the
                    cafe is a large open space event area that is also opened for 
                    people to use to get work done.

                <h1>Cafe 4</h1>
                <h3 class="location">Castro Valley, CA</h3>
                <p>This cafe is located in the 3 Crosses Church on top of the 
                    hill in Castro Valley. It's a wide open space inside the church
                    that makes it nice for studying and catching up with people. 
                    There are plenty of smaller tables and larger tables that seat
                    8 people.
