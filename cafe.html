                <h1>Cafe Recommendations in East Bay</h1>
                <p>As a former teacher, I've spent countless hours after school in cafes, 
                    grading papers, reading books, and answering emails. Since then, I have 
                    come to appreciate cafes a lot and many have asked me for my
                    recommendation, so here they are! (They all have wifi, relatively good
                    coffee, outlets, and easy parking.)
                </p>

                <h1>Allegro</h1>
                <h3 class="location">Berkeley, CA</h3>
                <p>Located in a Whole Foods market, the cafe has a wide open space, 
                    free wifi, and plenty of outlets along the walls. My favorite 
                    part about this place is you can also grab food from the hot deli 
                    section in Whole Foods.</p>
    
                <p>The high tables are also great for using as standing desks.</p>

                <h1>Kaleidoscope</h1>
                <h3 class="location">Point Richmond, CA</h3>
                <p>This place feels like home. It's a small and quaint place located 
                    in Point Richmond. There are these larger tables that seat 4 people
                    that's nice for studying in a group. The baristas are really friendly. 
                    There is also a section of the cafe with couches and beanbags. Sometimes,
                    before setting down at the cafe, I will go take a walk at the local park.
